# Latent Lab: Time Series Forecasting

This project was developed at the MIT Media Lab as part of the Latent Lab initiative. It explores time series forecasting using machine learning models, embeddings, and visualization tools.

## Initial testing

- Forecasts time series data using pretrained models
- Embeds movie summaries with the Nomic API
- Visualizes similarity between movies in 2D using PCA
- Uses The Movie Database (TMDb) API for additional metadata
